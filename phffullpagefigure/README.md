# The phffullpagefigure package

Typeset figures which fill up a full page of a document.

Provide a figure environment which provides the figure content on its own page,
with the corresponding caption reading for example "Figure 3 (on next page):
〈caption〉".


# Documentation

Run `make sty` to generate the style file, `make pdf` to generate the package
documentation, and `make install` to install the package in your local texmf
tree. Run 'make' or 'make help' for more info.
