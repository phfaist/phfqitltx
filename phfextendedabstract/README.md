# The phfextendedabstract package

Typeset extended abstracts for conferences, such as often encountered in quantum
information theory.

Several conferences in various fields (such as quantum information theory)
require the submission of *extended abstracts*.  An extended abstract is a
summary of a scientific result, presented at a high level, and consisting of at
most a small handful of pages. The `phfextendedabstract` LaTeX class provides a
simple style for such abstracts. There are only two sectioning levels, sections
and paragraphs, and the style is optimized to save space as well as to guide the
reader's eye through the overall structure of the document. An option will try
to compress all vertical space to save some space, in case you need to satisfy
page constraints. The style builds upon the powerful RevTeX class, so you can
use all of RevTeX' features such as author affiliations, etc.



# Documentation

Run `make sty` to generate the style file, `make pdf` to generate the package
documentation, and `make install` to install the package in your local texmf
tree. Run 'make' or 'make help' for more info.
