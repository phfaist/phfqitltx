# The phfqit package

Utilities to typeset stuff in Quantum Information Theory (quite biased towards
theory).

Provides macros to typeset some general mathematical operators (identity
operator, trace, diagonal, rank, ...), a powerful implementation of the bra-ket
notation (kets, bras, brakets, matrix elements etc. which can be sized as
required), delimited expressions such as averages and norms, and some basic Lie
algebra/group names. Provides also macros for entropy measures for quantum
information theory (smooth min- and max-entropy, smooth relative entropies,
etc.).
